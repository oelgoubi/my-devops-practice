# DevOps Labs Repository

Welcome to my DevOps Labs repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains my personal labs and practices in the DevOps universe, focusing on technologies such as Terraform, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, and more. Here, I experiment with various configurations, deployment strategies, and infrastructure as code (IaC) techniques.

## About

As a DevOps enthusiast, I believe in continuous learning and improvement. This repository serves as a playground for me to explore new concepts, tools, and best practices in the DevOps ecosystem. You'll find a diverse range of projects, including:

- **Terraform Modules**: Infrastructure provisioning and management using Terraform.
- **Kubernetes Configurations**: Deployment manifests, service definitions, and Helm charts for Kubernetes clusters.
- **ArgoCD Applications**: GitOps practices with ArgoCD for continuous deployment and application management.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Sample CI/CD configurations for different platforms such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins. ( Coming soon ! )
